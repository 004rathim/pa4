\section{Project plan}
Our goal is to make a program that accepts
L code and returns whether or not it types
correctly. If the program returns 1, then
the L code should run with the interpreter
with no run time errors. If the program 
returns 0, there may be run time errors. \newline
For now we don't plan to do polymorphic lists or any other extra credit. If we have time after completing the basic requirements, then we will think about it.
